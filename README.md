## Project Overview
As Lead Engineer, I managed and deployed **FortiGate firewalls** for **CBL Group (Ceylon Biscuits Ltd)** across multiple sites in **Sri Lanka and international factory locations**.  

The solution integrated **FortiGate NGFWs with Azure AD (SAML)** to provide **identity-based access control** and enforce **granular web filtering policies** for over **1,000 users** across production and corporate environments.  

---

## Business Challenges
- Multiple firewalls across sites with **no unified identity-based access**.  
- Need for **secure, role-based internet policies** for staff and production users.  
- Growing global operations required **standardized configurations**.  
- Limited visibility into **web usage and compliance**.  

---

## Solution Implemented
- **FortiGate NGFWs** deployed at HQ and international factory sites.  
- **Azure AD SAML integration** for user/group-based authentication.  
- **Granular web filtering** mapped to roles (corporate staff, production teams, guests).  
- Configured **site-to-site VPNs** to securely connect factories with HQ.  
- Standardized **security policies** directly on each FortiGate firewall.  

---

## Outcomes & Benefits
- **Identity-based internet access control** using Azure AD groups.  
- **Consistent firewall deployments** across Sri Lanka and overseas sites.  
- **Role-based web filtering** improved compliance and productivity.  
- **Enhanced visibility** into user activity across corporate and production environments.  
- **Scalable architecture** ready for global growth.  

---

## My Key Contributions
- Designed the **multi-country firewall deployment architecture**.  
- Integrated **Azure SAML authentication** with FortiGate firewalls.  
- Built **role-based policies and web filtering** for 1,000+ users.  
- Configured **VPNs** to interconnect Sri Lanka HQ with overseas factories.  
- Directed **cutover and migration** without service disruption.  
- Documented configurations and trained the internal IT team.
