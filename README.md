## üåç Project Overview
As Lead Engineer, I managed and deployed **FortiGate firewalls** for **CBL Group (Ceylon Biscuits Ltd)** across multiple sites in **Sri Lanka and international factory locations**.  

The solution integrated **FortiGate NGFWs with Azure AD (SAML)** to provide **identity-based access control** and enforce **granular web filtering policies** for over **1,000 users** across production and corporate environments.

## üéØ Business Challenges
- Multiple firewalls across sites with **no unified identity-based access**.  
- Need for **secure, role-based internet policies** for staff and production users.  
- Growing global operations required **standardized configurations**.  
- Limited visibility into **web usage and compliance**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Implemented
- **FortiGate NGFWs** deployed at HQ and international factory sites.  
- **Azure AD SAML integration** for user/group-based authentication.  
- **Granular web filtering** mapped to roles (corporate staff, production teams, guests).  
- Configured **site-to-site VPNs** to securely connect factories with HQ.  
- Standardized **security policies** directly on each FortiGate firewall.
